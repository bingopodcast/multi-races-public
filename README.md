Multi-Races is a pyprocgame implementation of the one ball horserace games from four different manufacturers.

There are currently 39 games available in this repository.  The public repository does not have the backglass artwork, but otherwise is a full implementation.

Games can be run in a multi-game system using menu.py or a single game can be run at a time using gamename/game.py from the root checkout.
